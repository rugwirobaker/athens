Athens developers get together for an hour or so approximately every week on a video chat to learn and discuss a part of the codebase. The hour is relatively unstructured, but generally it starts out with a core maintainer (usually [@arschles](https://github.com/arschles)) going into the details of a part of the codebase. From there, we just go where the questions take us.

This is a great opportunity for new community members to get more involved with the project in a low-pressure setting. It's also a great setting for existing community members to gain a deeper understanding into the codebase.

We meet at this [zoom](https://zoom.us/) video chat URL: [https://arschles.com/zoom](https://arschles.com/zoom)

>**Absolutely everybody is welcome to attend these meetings. You're free to suggest topics to talk about, share your perspective, and participate as little or much as you'd like**.
>
>You don't have to be a contributor to attend.

# The Zoom Software

Also, if you are using a Mac, there is a vulnerability that can allow arbitrary websites to activate your camera without your permission. Please see [here](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5) for more information.

If you haven't updated your Zoom software since July 10, 2019, please do so to fix this issue.
